== OUT Parameters

A `OutParameters` object represents a set of `OUT` parameters as result of a stored procedure/server-side function invocation.

=== Retrieving Values

The `Result` interface provides a `map(â€¦)` method for retrieving values from `Gettable` objects.
The `map` method accepts a `Function` (also referred to as mapping function) for `Gettable` which can be an implementation of `OutParameters` or `Row` objects or vendor-specific extensions.
The mapping function is called upon emission with `Gettable` objects.
A `Gettable` is only valid during the mapping function callback and is invalid outside of the mapping function callback.
Thus, `Gettable` objects must be entirely consumed by the mapping function.

The <<out-parameter-metadata>> section contains additional details on metadata.

[[out-parameters.methods]]
== Interface Methods

The following methods are available on the `OutParameters` interface:

* `Object get(int)` (inherited from `Gettable`)
* `Object get(String)` (inherited from `Gettable`)
* `<T> T get(int, Class<T>)` (inherited from `Gettable`)
* `<T> T get(String, Class<T>)` (inherited from `Gettable`)
* `OutParametersMetadata getMetadata()`

`get(int[, Class])` methods accept parameter indexes starting at `0`, `get(String[, Class])` methods accept parameter names as they are represented in the result.
Parameter names used as input to the `get` methods are case-insensitive.
The following example shows how to create and consume `OutParameters` by using its index:

.Creating and Consuming `OutParameters` by obtaining a parameter by index
====
[source,java]
----
// result is a Result object
Publisher<Object> values = result.map((gettable) -> gettable.get(0));
----
====

The following example shows how to create and consume `OutParameters` by using a parameter name:

.Creating and Consuming a `OutParameters` by obtaining a parameter by name
====
[source,java]
----
// result is a Result object
Publisher<Object> titles = result.map((gettable) -> gettable.get("title"));
----
====

Calling `get` without specifying a target type returns a suitable value representation according to <<datatypes.mapping>>.
When specifying a target type, the R2DBC driver tries to convert the value to the target type.
The following example shows how to create and consume `OutParameters` with type conversion:

.Creating and Consuming `OutParameters` with type conversion
====
[source,java]
----
// result is a Result object
Publisher<String> values = result.map((gettable) -> gettable.get(0, String.class));
----
====

You can consume multiple parameters from `OutParameters`, as the following example shows:

.Consuming multiple parameters from `OutParameters`
====
[source,java]
----
// result is a Result object
Publisher<Book> values = result.map((gettable) -> {
    String title = gettable.get("title", String.class);
    String author = gettable.get("author", String.class);

    return new Book(title, author);
});
----
====

When the parameter value in the database is SQL `NULL`, it can be returned to the Java application as `null`.

NOTE: `null` values cannot be returned as Reactive Streams values and must be wrapped for subsequent usage.

NOTE: Invalidating `OutParameters` does *not* release `Blob` and `Clob` objects that were obtained from `OutParameters`.
These objects remain valid for at least the duration of the transaction in which they were created, unless their `discard()` method is called.
